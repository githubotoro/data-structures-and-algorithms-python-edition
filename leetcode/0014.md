<summary>14. Longest Common Prefix</summary>

-   List sorting gives lexicographical order, so now you only need to find common between first and last strings -- that will be the common prefix for all strings
-   Time complexity: O(nlogn) (sorting) + 2\*O(m) (finding prefix), where n is the total number of strings and m is the maximum length of the string among all the strings in the list
