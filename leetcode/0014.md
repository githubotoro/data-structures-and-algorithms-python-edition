<summary>14. Longest Common Prefix</summary>

-   We just need to find 2 strings -- lexicographically smallest and lexicographically largest
-   Then, we only need to find common between these 2 strings -- that will be the common prefix for all strings
-   Time complexity: O(n) (array traversal) + O(m) (finding prefix), where n is the total number of strings and m is the maximum length of the string among all the strings in the list
