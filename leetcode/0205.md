<summary>205. Isomorphic Strings</summary>

-   We create 2 caches -- then, start traversing either of the strings
-   If s1 char exists in cache 1, if it does but is not equal to s2 char -- then, strings are not isomorphic
-   Else, if s2 char exists in cache 2, that means strings are not isomorphic (why? -- think yourself)
-   At the end in else statement, store s1 char in cache1 and s2 char in cache2
-   Linear time complexity, O(n) where n is the length of input string
