## How to run code?

1. Clone this repo + open in terminal
2. Write `Sample Input` in `input.txt` and `Sample Output` in `output.txt`
3. Open the `.py` file in the VSCode window
4. Click on run button on top-right corner of the window

> Note: Do not cd into nested folders, instead run .py directly from main folder -- because the input and output are fetched from main folder's input.txt and output.txt files.
