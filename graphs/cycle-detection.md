<summary>Cycle Detection Algorithm using DFS</summary>

-   We use DFS and maintain two hash sets visited + cycle
-   Time Complexity -- O(V + E), same as that of DFS traversal
-   Links: [Code](./graphs/cycle-detection.py)

#### Sample Input

```
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
3 5
```

#### Sample Output

```
True
```
